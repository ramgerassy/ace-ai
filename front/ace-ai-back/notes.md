# QuizMaster Backend - Limitations & Trade-offs

## Current Limitations

### 1. **AI-Related Limitations**

#### **Quiz Generation Reliability**

- **Issue**: LLM responses are non-deterministic, causing occasional failures
- **Impact**: 10-15% failure rate for quiz generation, especially with complex subjects
- **Subjects Most Affected**: Mathematics, advanced sciences, highly technical topics
- **Mitigation**: Multi-tier retry system, fallback to simpler prompts
- **Future Solution**: Implement structured output modes, fine-tuned models or comprhansive Rag system with a lot of scanned data.

#### **Mathematical Content Challenges**

- **Issue**: Complex mathematical notation doe sn't render well in plain text JSON
- **Examples**:
  - Matrix notation gets corrupted: `\begin{pmatrix}a & b\\c & d\end{pmatrix}`
  - LaTeX expressions become unreadable
  - Fractions, exponents, and symbols are problematic
- **Impact**: Poor quality MCQs for math-heavy subjects
- **Workaround**: Focus on conceptual rather than computational questions
- **Future Solution**: Support for MathML or LaTeX rendering

#### **Question Quality Inconsistency**

- **Issue**: AI-generated distractors (wrong answers) vary in quality
- **Problems**:
  - Sometimes obvious wrong answers
  - Occasionally nonsensical options
  - Difficulty in creating plausible wrong choices
- **Mitigation**: Multiple validation layers, quality scoring
- **Future Enhancement**: Implement answer quality assessment algorithms

#### **Subject Matter Depth**

  - GPT-4o: Higher limits but still constrained
- **Application Limits**:
  - Quiz generation: 10 requests per 15 minutes
  - Subject verification: 30 requests per 15 minutes
- **Impact**: Limited concurrent users
- **Scaling Challenge**: Expensive to increase limits significantly

#### **Memory Usage During Processing**

- **Weak Areas**: Mathematics, chemistry, physics, engineering
- **Missing**: Practical/hands-on subjects, regional/local content
- **Future Development**: Subject-specific prompt optimization

### 5. **Security & Privacy Limitations**

#### **Input Sanitization**

- **Current**: Basic Zod validation and regex filtering
- **Limitation**: May not catch sophisticated prompt injection attempts
- **Risk**: Malicious users could potentially manipulate AI responses
- **Enhancement Needed**: Advanced prompt injection detection

#### **Data Privacy**

- **Issue**: All user inputs are sent to OpenAI
- **Impact**: Potential privacy concerns for sensitive educational content
- **Compliance**: May not meet strict data protection requirements
- **Future Solution**: Local AI models for sensitive use cases

#### **API Key Security**

- **Current**: Environment variable storage
- **Limitation**: Key exposure in deployment environments
- **Risk**: Unauthorized usage if key is compromised
- **Future Enhancement**: Implement key rotation, secure vault integration
